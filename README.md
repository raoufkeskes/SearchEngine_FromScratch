# Building a search engine from scratch

An information retrieval project given by [**"Laure Soulier"**](http://www-connex.lip6.fr/~soulier/content/about.html) who's actually an Assistant professor at Sorbonne University specialized in Information Retrieval 
The project aims to understand how a search engine works and implement it from scratch using OOP paradigm for modularity , reusability and clarity

It is based on a lot of generic functions using different parameters inspired by scikit-learn functions signature .

### Implemented Functionalities 

- Documents Data Parser ( Simple | Regex ) 
- Queries Data Parser
- Indexing ( normal index , inverted index )
- Weighters ( 5 different types of ponderations applied on document , query and term )
- Models : 
  1. Vectorial
  2. Language model
  3. Okapi-BM25 

- Evaluation Metrics :
  1. Precision
  2. Recall
  3. F-measure
  4. Average Precision ( AvgP )
  5. Mean Average Precision ( MAP )
  6. Mean Reciprocal Rank ( MRR )
  7. Normalized Discounted cumulative gain ( NDCG )

- Models Evaluation Platform and Reporting
- Hyper-Parameters Tuning Platform using both split (test,train) and cross validation to tune our IR Models

- **PageRank Algorithm**
